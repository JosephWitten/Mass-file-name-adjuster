# Mass-file-name-adjuster
This is a tool used for when you have a directory with lots of files that have a phrase, common to all, that needs to be removed.

This tool is intended to be used on things such as, to remove labels from files. A general file cleaning tool.

To use this tool, install Main.class, open command prompt and type "java Main", assuming you are in the same directory.


This tool will be work the best when the word that you want to remove is specific eg in a directory of:
- Rock Bohemian Rhapsody.mp3
- Rock Smoke on the Water.mp3
- Rock Stairway to Heaven.mp3
- Rock a day in the life.mp3
A good word would be "Rock" as it is common to all and it is only used once. However the word "a" is not good because it will remove, not only the word but the letter "a" in various other strings.

In addition do not try to use this tool to remove whole files. It may work with folders but you will not be sucessfull with regular files
